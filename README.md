This project runs on my computer AND my laptop. 
Both are using Java 17 (the default one from the new update of android studio ) for the gradle. 
So it should be fine to clone, errors popped up when cloned onto my laptop but then I pressed start again and it ran fine.
I have reduced the minSDK to 24 just in case you are not using the latest pixel on the emulator.
I have tested it with the 5.1 WVGA emulation set up last year from the notes and if anything it worked better on there than the pixel.
